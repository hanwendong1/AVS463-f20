I developed this guide for students enrolled in Animal and Veterinary Science 463 Growth and Lactation class in fall 2020. The assignment requires identifying a topic for current topic debate and gathering research information that either supports or refutes the issue. Possible topics include: 
- Use of bST (growth hormone) to increase milk production
- Low-fat vs. whole milk consumption
- Organic vs. conventional farming
- Consumption of animal milk vs. plant-based milk
- Antibiotic use on farm
- Consumption of pasteurized milk vs. raw milk
- Contribution of dairy industry to greenhouse gases
- Separation of dairy cow from calf
