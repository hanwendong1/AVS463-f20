Print Books
One viable search strategy to find print books on the search topic is shelf browsing. That is visiting the bookshelves to browse the book collections with a particular subject focus area using LC call number. For example, if you are interested in Dairy processing and Dairy products, you would need to look for call numbers that start with SF250.5-275. Other relevant call numbers include: 
•	SF1-1100 Animal culture
•	SF94.5-99 Feeds and feeding. Animal nutrition
•	SF191-275 Cattle 
•	SF221-250 Dairying 
•	QP1-(981) Physiology
•	QP501-801 Animal biochemistry
Use the floor maps (https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/maps.html) to locate the shelves that contain the specified call number groups.
Government Documents
When searching the library catalog, you can filter the results by Government Documents under Resource Type. These documents are located on the library basement. You can click this link (https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/govdocs/) or email rattebur@uidaho.edu to learn more about how to access government documents. 
You can use Google to search for government documents as well. Add “site:.gov” at the end of your keyword search terms will yield results from government webpages.
Data and Statistics 
If you are looking for contextual information and overview of issue at stake for your presentation, consider incorporating some data and statistics on production, consumption, price, or standards:

•	Milk marketing order statistics: https://www.ams.usda.gov/resources/marketing-order-statistics
•	USDA economic research service dairy data: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data/
•	USDA dairy products grades and standards: https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/dairy-products
•	US dairy export council: https://www.usdec.org/research-and-data/market-information/dairy-data-dashboard
•	USDA dairy products monthly production data: https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/m326m1757?locale=en#

Citation Styles
Remember to cite your sources and format them according to either Journal of Animal Science (https://academic.oup.com/jas/pages/General_Instructions) or Journal of Dairy Science (https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/jods/JDS_Instruct_for_Contributors_SF.pdf). 
You may also consider using a citation manager (if you have never used one before) to cite your sources. A citation manager is a time saver, and is incredibly useful if you are thinking about pursuing a master’s or doctoral degree in which considerable writing is expected. The library is hosting a workshop on Citation Management with Zotero via Zoom on Tuesday, September 29, 2020 from 12:30pm to 1:30pm. Feel free to register and attend the live session if you want to ask any questions. A recording of a past session is available as well.
