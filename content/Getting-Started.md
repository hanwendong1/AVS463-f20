# Boolean Logic
When conducting college-level research, there is a general process to follow:

{% capture text %}

1. Select topic
2. Use Boolean logic to expand or narrow key concepts or keywords
3. Select a database
4. Evaluate and revise search strategy
5. Choose items and find full-text online or in print

{% endcapture %}

Since you have already selected your topic, this guide will focus on the other aspects of research process. First, let’s talk about Boolean logic. 

Boolean logic used Boolean operators (such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) to narrow, expand, or define your search, and is applicable to conducting searches in library catalog and most databases. Writing out your search terms using Boolean operators by connecting pieces of information and coming up with synonyms is a good exercise as it can specify wanted results and filter out unrelated results. These are some of the most common Boolean operators you can use:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
         table, td, th {
            border: 1px solid black;
            border-collapse: collapse;
            padding: 15px;

            width: 300px;
         }
      </style>
   </head>
   <body>
      <table>
         <tr>
            <th>Boolean Operator</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
            <th>Example</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td style="text-align:Center">AND</td>
            <td style="text-align:Left">All search terms must be present in the results</td>
            <td style="text-align:Left">Antibiotic AND farm</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td style="text-align:Center">OR</td>
            <td style="text-align:Left">Results can include any of the search terms</td>
            <td style="text-align:Left">lactation OR secretion OR yield</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </body>
</html>
